                            <h2>What is an Education Loan?</h2>
                            Education loans are a form of financial aid that helps students study without worrying about the associated costs. There are different education loans available in the lending marketplace, and students can explore the options to find the most suitable option for their profile. Education loans are also known as Student Loans.
                       </p>
                       <p>In the study abroad space, education loans financially empower students to explore great opportunities in foreign universities. While the cost of studying abroad can be hefty for the average student from an ordinary, middle-class family, an education loan helps the student study in top-tier universities and explore better academic and professional opportunities.</p>
                       <p>Unlike in the past, education loan options are broadened today, catering to the needs of students from different financial backgrounds. We, at Nomad, attempt to bridge the gap by offering expert guidance and tailored solutions for your educational needs. </p>

                    <p className='text-center'>There are mainly three types of lenders who offer education loans to study abroad - banks, NBFCs, and international lenders.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>	Banks: Banks have been the conventional resort for education loans for years since the establishment of education loans. In India, public and private banks offer secured and unsecured education loans to study abroad. Prominent banks in the US also offer student loans to international students.	</li>
                        <li>	NBFCs: Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) offer education loans to needy students with affordable terms and conditions. Compared to banks, NBFCs have relaxed terms in accepting your loan application.	</li>
                        <li>	International lenders: International lenders are financial institutions with capital in one country and operations in more countries. Unlike banks or NBFCs, they offer hassle-free education loans if your profile is eligible.	</li>

                    <p className='text-center'>Taking an education loan is an important financial decision you make while being a student. Here are some checkpoints to ensure you get the best education loan: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>	Interest rates: It is best to go for an education loan that has the lowest interest rates for you. Low rates of interest will help you save money, and even a small difference in interest rates can cost a significant amount in loan repayment.	</li>
                        <li>	Interest difference in different countries: Usually, the rate of interest will be lower in INR rates compared to USD rates. When you see an education loan in the US currency offers lower interest than education loans in India, be mindful that the rates will be much higher when converted to the Indian currency.	</li>
                        <li>	Repayment period: You must choose an education loan that offers you a sufficient repayment tenure. You can either negotiate with the lender or choose a different loan option if you come across issues related to your repayment tenure.	</li>
                        <li>	Tax benefits: Education loans from Indian banks and HDFC Credila offer you tax benefits under Section 80 E. You can prioritize education loan options with tax benefits to save more money.	</li>
                        <li>	Other costs: There will be other charges, like Forex conversion, processing fee, Insurance cost, etc. Go through them and choose the loan option with the least possible charges.	</li>
                    </ul>

                        Margin money refers to the amount that the student has to contribute to the total loan amount. For example, if your loan has a 5% margin, you will get only 95% of the loan amount, and it's your duty to add the remaining 5% to the loan.

                            <p>Yes. If approved, many lenders offer education loans with no margin money that cover 100% of your expenses. However, it is mandatory that you meet the eligibility requirements.

                        From Indian lenders, students can get up to INR 1.5 Cr and from banks in the US, the maximum loan amount can be up to INR 1.8 Cr. If approved, the maximum loan amount depends on your co-borrower's income (or collateral value), country and course of study, and similar other factors.

                                In India, the co-borrower must be a close relative of the student, such as a parent, sibling, spouse, parent-in-law, etc. The co-borrower must be earning the minimum income specified by lenders without any other obligations, as well as other eligibility requirements to be approved

                                However, for US banks, the co-borrower can be anyone who is a US citizen or a permanent resident in the country. Like in India, the co-borrower must meet the income criteria and other eligibility requirements to be approved.

                                Education loan insurance helps when unexpected events, like the student's untimely demise, occur. The insurance company will take care of the loan, thereby not troubling the student's family with repayment.
